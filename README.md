# Welcome to Job Application Tracker

## Project info

This project originally started as an attempt to vibe code using Lovable.  Lovable came up with a halfway decent prototype UI, but couldn't get anything else right, so I've stopped using it.  Instead, I've been throwing coding tools at the mess in an attempt to fix it, and to give me a feel for their unique strengths and weaknesses.  Each fork has their own branch here in this repo.  Somewhere along the line I may split into separate repos, but not today:

`using-codex`: ChatGPT Codex - using codex-1 (o3)

`using-copilot`: Github Copilot - primarily using o4-mini

`using-warp`: Warp - using Claude 4 Sonnet

## How can I run this code?

I can't guarantee `main` or any of the above branches will be in a working state.  In the future I may try to guarantee `main` works, but again, not today. 

Nominally, follow these steps:

```sh
# Step 1: Clone the repository using the project's Git URL.
git clone <YOUR_GIT_URL>

# Step 2: Navigate to the project directory.
cd <YOUR_PROJECT_NAME>

# Step 3: Install the necessary dependencies.
npm i

# Step 4: Start the development server with auto-reloading and an instant preview.
npm run dev
```
