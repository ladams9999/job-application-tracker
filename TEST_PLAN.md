- ❌ **Autocomplete Functionality**
  - Company dropdown opens/closes correctly
  - Job title dropdown opens/closes correctly
  - Selecting items updates form values
  - Typing in search filters results
  - "Use current input" button works when no matches found
  
- ❌ **Edge Cases**
  - Empty arrays for companies/jobTitles
  - Null/undefined previousEntries
  - Very long company/job title names
  - Special characters in search input
  - Anonymous toggle disables company field

### 2. ErrorBoundary Component
**Status: ❌ PENDING**

#### Critical Test Cases:
- ❌ **Error Handling**

  - Renders fallback UI when error occurs
  - Calls onError callback when provided
  - Console logs error details
  
- ❌ **Recovery Scenarios**
  - Fallback renders CompanyFields correctly
  - Form remains functional after error
  - Error boundary resets on component remount

### 3. ApplicationFormFields Component
**Status: ❌ PENDING**

#### Critical Test Cases:
- ❌ **Component Selection Logic**
  - Renders CompanyFields when `enableAutocomplete=false`
  - Renders CompanyFieldsWithAutocomplete when `enableAutocomplete=true`
  - Error boundary wraps autocomplete correctly
  
- ❌ **Data Safety**
  - Handles undefined previousEntries gracefully
  - Creates safe default arrays for missing data
  - Maintains default sources when missing

## Phase 2: Data Flow Testing

### 4. usePreviousEntriesLoader Hook
**Status: ❌ PENDING**

#### Critical Test Cases:
- ❌ **Data Loading**
  - Returns loading state initially
  - Fetches suggestions from API
  - Sets loading to false after completion
  
- ❌ **Error Handling**
  - Returns default data on API failure
  - Maintains loading state during errors
  - Logs errors appropriately
  
- ❌ **Data Validation**
  - Ensures arrays are always arrays
  - Provides fallback for missing sources
  - Handles malformed API responses

### 5. useApplicationForm Hook
**Status: ❌ PENDING**

#### Critical Test Cases:
- ❌ **State Management**
  - Combines loading states correctly
  - Watches source field for recruiter fields
  - Returns all required properties
  
- ❌ **Integration**
  - Works with form validation
  - Handles edit mode properly
  - Manages form submission state

---

## Phase 3: Integration Testing

### 6. ApplicationForm Page Integration
**Status: ❌ PENDING**

#### Critical Test Cases:
- ❌ **Route Handling**
  - Add mode works correctly
  - Edit mode loads existing data
  - Component remounts on route change
  
- ❌ **Feature Toggling**
  - Autocomplete can be enabled/disabled
  - Form works in both modes
  - No functionality lost when switching

### 7. Form Submission Flow
**Status: ❌ PENDING**

#### Critical Test Cases:
- ❌ **Data Integrity**
  - Anonymous applications save correctly
  - Recruiter fields save when source is "Recruiter"
  - All form fields preserve values
  
- ❌ **Error Scenarios**
  - Network errors during submission
  - Validation errors display correctly
  - Form remains editable after errors

---

## Phase 4: Edge Case and Stress Testing

### 8. Performance and Edge Cases
**Status: ❌ PENDING**

#### Critical Test Cases:
- ❌ **Large Datasets**
  - Performance with 1000+ companies
  - Search responsiveness with large lists
  - Memory usage optimization
  
- ❌ **Browser Compatibility**
  - Works in different browsers
  - Handles keyboard navigation
  - Accessibility compliance
  
- ❌ **Network Conditions**
  - Slow network responses
  - Intermittent connectivity
  - API timeout scenarios

---

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Testing
- **Framework**: Jest + React Testing Library
- **Coverage Goal**: 90% for high-risk components
- **Focus**: Individual component behavior and edge cases

### Integration Testing
- **Framework**: Jest + React Testing Library
- **Coverage Goal**: 80% for component interactions
- **Focus**: Data flow between components and hooks

### End-to-End Testing
- **Framework**: Playwright or Cypress
- **Coverage Goal**: Critical user journeys
- **Focus**: Complete form submission workflows

### Manual Testing Checklist
- ❌ Test autocomplete in different browsers
- ❌ Verify error boundaries in development mode
- ❌ Test with slow network connections
- ❌ Validate accessibility with screen readers
- ❌ Test keyboard-only navigation

---

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk Areas
1. **CompanyFieldsWithAutocomplete** - Complex state management and external dependencies
2. **Data Loading Logic** - Async operations with error handling
3. **Form State Management** - Integration between multiple hooks and components

### Medium Risk Areas
1. **Error Boundary Implementation** - Error recovery mechanisms
2. **Route-based Component Mounting** - State persistence across navigation

### Low Risk Areas
1. **Simple Input Components** - Basic form fields with minimal logic
2. **Static UI Components** - Headers, labels, and layout components

---

## Success Criteria

### Stability Metrics
- ❌ Zero "undefined is not iterable" errors in production
- ❌ Error boundary catches and recovers from all component errors
- ❌ Form submission success rate > 99%

### Performance Metrics
- ❌ Autocomplete search response time < 100ms
- ❌ Component mount time < 50ms
- ❌ Memory usage stable over extended use

### User Experience Metrics
- ❌ Zero data loss during form interactions
- ❌ Consistent behavior across all supported browsers
- ❌ Accessibility score > 95%

---

## Implementation Timeline

### Week 1: Foundation
- ❌ Set up testing framework
- ❌ Implement critical component tests
- ❌ Establish CI/CD testing pipeline

### Week 2: Coverage
- ❌ Complete unit test coverage
- ❌ Implement integration tests
- ❌ Add performance benchmarks

### Week 3: Validation
- ❌ End-to-end test implementation
- ❌ Manual testing and validation
- ❌ Documentation and training

---

## Maintenance Guidelines

### Test Maintenance
- Update tests when components change
- Add new tests for bug fixes
- Review and update edge cases quarterly

### Documentation Updates
- Keep this plan current with implementation status
- Document new test patterns and discoveries
- Share learnings with development team

### Regression Prevention
- Run full test suite before releases
- Monitor error rates in production
- Implement alerting for critical failures

---

## Notes and Discoveries

### Known Issues
- Command component from cmdk library is sensitive to undefined data
- Error boundaries don't catch async errors in useEffect
- Form state can be lost during rapid navigation

### Best Practices Learned
- Always validate data before passing to external components
- Implement loading states for all async operations
- Use error boundaries for component isolation

### Future Improvements
- Consider implementing retry logic for failed API calls
- Add user feedback for network issues
- Implement progressive enhancement for autocomplete features
