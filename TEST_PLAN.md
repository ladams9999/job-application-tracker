**Status: ❌ PENDING**

#### Critical Test Cases:
- ❌ **Large Datasets**
  - Performance with 1000+ companies
  - Search responsiveness with large lists
  - Memory usage optimization
  
- ❌ **Browser Compatibility**
  - Works in different browsers
  - Handles keyboard navigation
  - Accessibility compliance
  
- ❌ **Network Conditions**
  - Slow network responses
  - Intermittent connectivity
  - API timeout scenarios
